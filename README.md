# fun-with-Java
A collection of Java Projects including creating character methods and making a university directory.
charStrMethods is my own creation and implementation of already provided character and string methods - this also includes a series of tests.
uniDirectory is a program that adds, stores, and retrieves information (such as name, age, course, module, address, etc.) of students, TAs, and professors in a university - essentially a practice in OOP.
